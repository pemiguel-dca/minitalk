The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
In this project you will be able to see a communication between a server and a client, that communication is made using UNIX signals, since we only could use 2 signals in this project we communicate over zero's and one's (binary).

To run this small project you need to run 'make', and you'll see that both server and client were created, first you open your server which is displaying a PID, you'll use that PID in the server later as your first argument and your second is the message you want to send.

PS: The '.bonus' files are exactly the same as the others it's just a thing that 42School does to separate bonus from mandatory.
